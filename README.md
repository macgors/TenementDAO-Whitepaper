We have an offer to buy a [building](building.md) near city center of city Katowice in Poland for about 900k Euro.

We want to raise money for that => buy the property => fix it => rent out\
\
How:\
2000 NFT's that will represent ownership of the property, each NFT holder will recive monhly yield in $TND tokens \
\
Value:

* Token/NFT will have a real world value
* We want to do some good things for the world, look at our [ideas](ideas.md)\


DAO members can:

* get money from earnings of the rented apartments,&#x20;
* make vote for different decisions like what project to choose,&#x20;
* spend some time in the special apartment for DAO members to visit the city \
