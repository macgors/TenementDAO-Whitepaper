# Introduction

We have an offer to buy a [building](building.md) near city center of city Katowice in Poland for about 900k Euro.

We want to raise money for that => buy the property => fix it => rent out\
\
DAO members can:

* get money from earnings of the rented apartments,&#x20;
* make vote for different decisions like what project to choose,&#x20;
* spend some time in the special apartment for DAO members to visit the city&#x20;

Token:&#x20;

* will have a real world value,&#x20;
* token can be deflatory for gratitude of a HODLers (5% of each transition dividend into two parts, first one burn, second one will go into project Treasury and may collect more for future purchases of different real estates for the DAO community)\
