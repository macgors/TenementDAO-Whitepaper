# Introduction

We have an offer to buy a building near city center of my city Katowice in Poland for about 900k Euro, the building needs to be renovated and than flats can be rented for the income of a DAO treasury \
\
What we want to do:\
\- can be tied up to get funds and to make a earnings for HOLDers, \
\- members can make decisions for different decisions like what project to choose, tokens will have a real world value. \
\- token can be deflatory for gratitude of a HODLers (5% of each transition dividend into two parts, first one burn, second one will go into project Treasury and may collect more for future purchases of different real estates for the DAO)\
\
